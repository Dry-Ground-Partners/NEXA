# 🔧 Build Fix Applied - Python Version Compatibility

## Problem

Render was using Python 3.13.4 (newest), but Pillow 10.1.0 doesn't support Python 3.13 yet.

Error:
```
KeyError: '__version__'
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Pillow Version
**File:** `requirements.txt`
```diff
- Pillow==10.1.0
+ Pillow==10.4.0   # ← Supports Python 3.13
```

### 2. Pinned Python Version (for stability)
**File:** `runtime.txt` (NEW)
```
python-3.11.9
```

This ensures Render uses Python 3.11.9 instead of the bleeding-edge 3.13.

## Why Python 3.11?

- ✅ Fully stable and tested
- ✅ All dependencies have proper support
- ✅ WeasyPrint works perfectly
- ✅ Render has optimized builds for 3.11
- ✅ Production-ready

Python 3.13 is too new - many packages haven't caught up yet.

## Deploy Instructions

### Step 1: Commit
```bash
git add pdf-service-root/requirements.txt pdf-service-root/runtime.txt
git commit -m "Fix: Pin Python 3.11 and update Pillow for compatibility"
git push
```

### Step 2: Redeploy
1. Render Dashboard → `nexa-pdf-service`
2. **Manual Deploy** → **Deploy latest commit**
3. Watch the logs - build should succeed now ✅

### Expected Build Output
```
