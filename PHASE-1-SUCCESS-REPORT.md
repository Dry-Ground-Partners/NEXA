## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Hot-Reloadable Configuration System**
```typescript
// Event definitions update immediately
await eventRegistry.updateEventDefinition('new_event', {
  baseCredits: 10,
  description: 'New event type',
  category: 'ai_analysis'
})

// Available within 5 minutes (or immediately with cache refresh)
const event = await eventRegistry.getEventDefinition('new_event')
```

### **Dynamic Credit Calculation**
```typescript
// Base credits + complexity multipliers + feature bonuses
Base: 10 credits
+ Complexity (2.0x): 20 credits  
+ Echo feature: +5 credits
+ Traceback feature: +3 credits
= Total: 28 credits
```

### **Organization-Scoped Tracking**
```typescript
// Tracks to specific organization with user attribution
await trackUsage({
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  userId: 'user-456', 
  eventType: 'structuring_diagnose',
  creditsConsumed: 15
})
```

## 🚀 **READY FOR PHASE 2**

### **What's Ready Now:**
- ✅ Complete usage tracking infrastructure
- ✅ Organization-based billing attribution  
- ✅ Dynamic pricing and credit system
- ✅ Hot-reloadable configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive analytics foundation

### **What Phase 2 Will Add:**
- 🔄 Integration with existing AI API routes

- 🔄 Real-time usage displays
- 🔄 Organization management integration

### **Integration Pattern for Phase 2:**
```typescript
// Add this to any AI API route
import { withUsageTracking } from '@/lib/middleware/usage-middleware'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { orgId: string } }) {
  // Track usage (handles limits, attribution, calculations)
  const tracking = await withUsageTracking(request, params.orgId, {
    eventType: 'structuring_diagnose',
    eventData: { complexity: 2.0, echo: true }
  })

  // Your existing AI logic here...
  const result = await processAI(input)

  // Return with usage info
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    result,
    usage: {
      creditsConsumed: tracking.creditsConsumed,
      remainingCredits: tracking.remainingCredits
    }
  })
}
```

2. **Add usage tracking middleware** to the route
3. **Test end-to-end** usage tracking
4. **Verify organization attribution** works correctly
5. **Continue with remaining API routes**

### **For Testing Current Implementation:**
```bash
# 1. Start development server
npm run dev

# 2. Test configuration API
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config

# 3. Test demo usage tracking
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/demo/track-usage \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"organizationId":"test","eventType":"structuring_diagnose"}'

# 4. Run full system demo
npx tsx src/scripts/demo-usage-tracking.ts
```
