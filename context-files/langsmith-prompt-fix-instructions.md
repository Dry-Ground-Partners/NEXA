# üõ†Ô∏è LANGSMITH PROMPT CONTAMINATION FIX

## üö® **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

Your `nexa-structuring-painpoints` prompt contains **embedded business examples** that are contaminating the AI responses.

## üìç **CONTAMINATED LINES TO REMOVE**

In your LangSmith `nexa-structuring-painpoints` prompt, find and **REMOVE** these contaminated examples:

### **Line 1 (Define section):**
```
REMOVE: (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, QuickBooks, CRM)
```

### **Line 2 (Analyze section):**  
```
REMOVE: (e.g., 'Outlook rules misroute renewal emails into staff folders, causing 2‚Äì3 day delays')
```

## ‚úÖ **CLEAN VERSION**

**Replace the contaminated lines with these clean versions:**

**BEFORE (Contaminated):**
```
Define ‚Üí What the problem is, where it occurs, which platform/tool is involved (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, QuickBooks, CRM).
```

**AFTER (Clean):**
```
Define ‚Üí What the problem is, where it occurs, which platform/tool is involved.
```

**BEFORE (Contaminated):**
```
Analyze ‚Üí Root cause analysis that is realistic and descriptive, explicitly naming systems, tools, or manual actions that cause the issue (e.g., 'Outlook rules misroute renewal emails into staff folders, causing 2‚Äì3 day delays').
```

**AFTER (Clean):**
```
Analyze ‚Üí Root cause analysis that is realistic and descriptive, explicitly naming systems, tools, or manual actions that cause the issue.
```

## üéØ **VERIFICATION**

After making these changes:
1. **Test with your Python prime number input**
2. **Should analyze YOUR content, not business scenarios**
3. **No more Salesforce/Zendesk hallucinations**

## üîß **OPTIONAL: MODEL FIX**

Also consider changing the model from `gpt-4.1` to `gpt-4o` to match the working Generate Solution prompt.

**The contamination is 100% from these embedded examples in your prompt template!**
