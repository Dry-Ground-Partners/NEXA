---

## 🔧 MANUAL ACTIONS REQUIRED

### **1. Add Environment Variable**

**Why:** Tell the app where draw.io is hosted

**Action:** Add this line to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_DRAWIO_URL=https://app.diagrams.net
```

**Note:** You don't need to create `.env.local` if it doesn't exist yet - Next.js will use the default (public CDN) automatically.

---

### **2. Restart Development Server**

**Why:** Load the new environment variable

**Action:**
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

---

### **3. Test the Integration**

#### **Test 1: Standalone HTML Test** (Optional but recommended)

1. Open `test-drawio.html` in your browser
2. Wait for "Ready ✓" status
3. Click "Load Sample Diagram"
4. Edit the diagram in the editor
5. Click "Export PNG"
6. Verify image appears in preview

**Expected:** All features work, PNG export displays

---

#### **Test 2: NEXA /visuals Integration** (Main Test)

1. Navigate to `/visuals` in your app
2. Create or load a session
3. Go to a diagram tab
4. Click the image upload area
5. You should see TWO buttons:
   - "Upload from Device" (existing)
   - "Open in Draw.io Advanced Editing" (NEW ✨)
6. Click "Open in Draw.io Advanced Editing"
7. Wait for editor to load
8. Create a simple diagram
9. Click "Save & Close"
10. Verify:
    - Image preview shows your diagram
    - Session has unsaved changes indicator
11. Save the session
12. Reload the page
13. Verify diagram is still there

**Expected:** Full workflow works end-to-end

---

#### **Test 3: Edit Existing Diagram**

1. In /visuals, create a diagram using Draw.io
2. Save it
3. Reload the page
4. Open the same diagram in Draw.io again
5. Make changes
6. Save

**Expected:** Your previous diagram loads and changes are saved

---

#### **Test 4: Size Limit**

1. Create a very complex diagram (100+ shapes)
2. Try to export

**Expected:** Warning if > 5MB

---

## 📊 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **How It Works:**

1. **User clicks "Open in Draw.io Advanced Editing"**
   - Sets `editingDiagramId` to current diagram ID
   - Opens DrawioEditor modal
   - Passes current `sketch` value as XML (or null for blank)

2. **Editor loads**
   - iframe loads `https://app.diagrams.net/?embed=1&proto=json&spin=1&libraries=1&noSaveBtn=1&ui=atlas`
   - Waits for `event: "init"` message
   - Sends `action: "load"` with XML (or blank template)
   - Enables autosave with `autosave: 1`

3. **User edits diagram**
   - draw.io runs entirely in iframe (client-side)
   - No data sent to external servers
   - Autosave events update `currentXML` state

4. **User clicks "Save & Close"**
   - Sends `action: "export", format: "png"`
   - Receives `event: "export"` with Base64 PNG
   - Validates size (< 5MB)
   - Calls `onSave(xml, png)`

5. **Data is saved**
   - `handleDrawioSave` updates diagram set:
     - `sketch` = XML (draw.io source)
     - `image` = PNG (Base64 data URI)
   - Sets `hasUnsavedChanges = true`
   - User saves session normally

### **Storage Strategy:**

```typescript
DiagramSet {
  id: 1,
  ideation: "User's initial idea",
  planning: "AI-generated planning",
  sketch: "<mxGraphModel>...</mxGraphModel>", // ← draw.io XML
  image: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0...",  // ← Generated PNG
  expandedContent: "",
  isExpanded: false
}
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ No database schema changes needed
- ✅ JSONB already supports this
- ✅ Backward compatible (old sessions without XML still work)
- ✅ Can re-edit diagrams (XML preserved)
- ✅ Image preview works (PNG generated)

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR TESTING

### **Browser Console**
Open DevTools (F12) and watch for:
- `📨 Draw.io message: init` - Editor ready
- `📤 Sending: load` - Loading diagram
- `💾 Saving Draw.io diagram` - Save triggered
- `✅ Diagram updated successfully` - Saved to state

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue:** Editor doesn't load
- **Check:** Browser console for CORS errors
- **Fix:** Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRAWIO_URL` is set

**Issue:** "Save & Close" doesn't work
- **Check:** Console for error messages
- **Fix:** Wait for "Ready ✓" status before saving

**Issue:** Image doesn't appear after save
- **Check:** Console logs for export data
- **Fix:** Verify PNG data is in Base64 format

**Issue:** Diagram doesn't persist after reload
- **Check:** Did you save the session?
- **Fix:** Click main "Save" button in /visuals

## 📝 NOTES

### **What's Using the Public CDN?**
For Phase 1, we're using `https://app.diagrams.net` (public CDN).

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero setup required
- ✅ Always up-to-date
- ✅ Perfect for testing

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ External dependency
- ⚠️ User browsers communicate with diagrams.net

**For Production (Phase 2):**
- We'll set up Docker self-hosting
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRAWIO_URL` to our domain
- Complete data isolation

### **Security Note**
Even with public CDN:
- ✅ Diagram data stays in your browser
- ✅ No upload to draw.io servers
- ✅ Data saved to NEXA database only
- ⚠️ Origin validation in place
