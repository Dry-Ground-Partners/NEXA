This right sidebar will be basically a cursor-like assistant on my website, which is a SaaS application, but it will do basically a lot of things. Let me explain first how it works as a chat message. So, initially, what happens is that the user will send a message. After the user sends a message, right after, we will always have stored something called a hidden message, which is a message that the system has already generated, and it will be instantly posted on the chat to keep the user engaged. While that is being displayed on the chat, two asynchronous requests are going to be done. One for a pre-response, another one for the response. The pre-response is posted first. The response is posted second. The pre-response is posted first because it's going to be shorter and return faster. The response is going to be larger, so it's going to return later and post it later. If the response beats the pre-response, then the response gains priority, and the pre-response is ignored. When the response is posted on the chat, the next hidden message will be generated. The dynamics of that is that upon receiving the response, the response is appended to the context, and we ask the model to prepare a hidden message. So, when the response starts to be displayed on the chat, the request for the next hidden message will be already running, meaning that when the response fully loads in the chat and the user finishes reading, the next hidden message will be already generated. And when the user sends a message, the hidden message will be again instantly posted on the chat. This fast behavior will always keep the user engaged. So, let me explain the contents of each type of message. The hidden message is a general message that includes elements of the context in a more generic way, since during the time of the hidden message, the model did not yet read the newest message from the user. And the hidden message will always contain things like the model saying that it needs to think for a bit, that it is considering and that it is ruminating on the content. Always mentioning elements of the context to keep the user engaged because it's within the theme. The pre-response, on the other hand, will be an aha moment. And basically, since during the pre-response, the latest user message was already appended to the context, the pre-response will be a short, fast, and adequate response of the model saying that it understands the user, it understands the request, and explaining how it is going to do. But very quickly, both hidden message and pre-response will be roughly a paragraph. A shorter paragraph for the hidden message is like a greater paragraph for the pre-response. So we have the response. The response could vary, but I will expect three paragraphs. And the response is actually the full request done by the user. This full response done by the user. Sorry, the request being responded now in the response will contain everything from the request of the user. And maybe an identifier will be in response to alert another model for possible tool usage. But we will not get into it right now. So to recap, a hidden message is a context-influenced message where the model say it is thinking, it mentions some things about the context. The pre-response is an a-ha moment where the model says that it now understands it and will respond adequately and do the request. And the response is the full request being done. The hidden message and the pre-response are basically getting time so the response is calculated. And the response will be calculated right after the user message. Right after the user message is posted in the chat. Remember, as soon as a user posts the message in the chat, two requests instantly occur asynchronously, which is for the pre-response and for the response. As soon as the response object returns, two things happen instantly. One is posting the response on the chat, and secondly is the request for the next hidden message to be triggered. So when the user sends the next message, we already have ready the next hidden message. It's very important to remember that the next hidden message is always calculated when we receive the response text. And the reason I say that is because this is going to have a voice mode. During the voice mode, when the user sends a message, we will both have a text and an audio that will both be instantly posted on the chat while the user is listening and reading to the audio. The two same requests are done asynchronously. A pre-response and a response. They occur exactly the same and are exactly the same. The only difference is each one of them after the text for the pre-response and for the response is generated, we will use transcription. We will use Whisper, OpenAI's Whisper, to transform into audio. All of that is being done asynchronously. And in the same way, the pre-response will be posted in the chat and right after the response will be posted in the chat. But now, as first text and audio and second text and audio, so the pre-response text and audio are posted at the same moment in the chat, so the user will listen concurrently to reading. The same will occur for the pre-response. The text being posted on the chat will happen at the very same time that the response starts playing. And this should be the behavior for all models when they're in voice mode, is that when the text is posted in the chat, the audio will instantly start to play. One thing that we will do is the effect of streaming the letters. Maybe it has another name for this effect, and you can help me remembering the name, but it's basically how OpenAI also does putting one letter at a time and completing it one letter at a time so the users can see the text and the text parts being added instantly in front of them. And the same behavior then occurs here. The user sends a message. It starts to display the hidden message at the same time that it plays the hidden message's audio. It starts to display right after the pre-response while playing the pre-response audio at the same time. And then it will start to display the response while playing the audio for the response at the same time. And the same behavior will occur where the user sends a message and two concurrent requests are done, one to generate a pre-response and another one to generate a response. But each one will trigger right after the text is generated, it will trigger whisper, so the audio will be generated as well. As in for the next hidden message, it triggers the same way you would trigger in outside of the voice mode, which is when the text for the response arrives, not when the audio for the response arrives. So both inside voice mode and outside of voice mode, the next hidden message is generated and the next hidden message is generated. And outside of voice mode, the next hidden message is generated when the text for the response arrives. So when the response text starts to be displayed while the response's audio starts to play, the next hidden message request will be running, initially generating the text, and with the text generating through a request to whisper the audio as well. What I will use for the text is GPT-5 Nano. And what I will use for the audio is OpenAI's Whisper. Those are the fastest and cheapest.I will use Langsmith for prompt versioning. And what I want to do is... I want to have in the context of the model first the previous messages. So the model always has a context of the conversation. And we can do that through LengCheng. But part will be logs. The user will be using the software, doing requests, moving around the website, and part of the logs of the activity will be saved and appended to the context. This way the model will understand what the user is doing and talk more directly, referencing the things that the user did on the UI. The user will feel that it's being watched, but it will also feel that it's being taken care of. Because the logs will also show in the chat sometimes, so the user can troubleshoot, debug, or simply understand what is happening.Great, I love it. Here are two extra things I want you to describe, but independently of what we already wrote, it's just like more details. So what I want you to do programmatically is to check on the user's input length, because it might not be that big. If the user talks a lot or types a lot, it might be big, but if the user gives a quick command, we should check the amount of characters. And if it's not greater than an amount of characters, we should skip the hidden message, because then it might feel out of place. For example, if the user asks the model to move to a specific page and it's still talking about the workflow. So then the pre-response and the response alone will do. So basically, by checking the amount of characters, it will check, is this simple? If it's simple, it ignores the hidden message and does, instead of posting the hidden message, it just does the rest of the workflow. The two other requests, pre-response and response, the next hidden message, and that's it. But if it identifies that it is not simple, the hidden message is instantly posted on the chat. Another thing that you can add on this next snippet is that sometimes these could error out. If they error out, we could have some pre-built messages. Something natural saying, wait, I actually don't understand, I failed to do my task, I think I have a problem, can we try this again? Could you request again? Or we could have like a little retry policy, it tries two more times, so it says, oh, sorry, I tried but I failed, I'm going to try one more time, just wait a second. And if it fails two more times, it just says, well, I think I'm having a problem, could you help me? Could you repeat or maybe explain differently? Or something along these lines. So these are two things that I want to add and you don't have to rewrite the whole snippet, just write a new snippet explaining these parts very well, so that would be enough. Okay, here's the final snippet that I want you to write because it's another thing that is very important for this solution, which is we're going to use Vosk speech-to-text, STT, and we're going to run Vosk on the server, on the main server, so we can get the fastest possible response. Of course, the user will choose between typing or speaking. If the user types, everything goes normal. If the user chooses to speak, we use Vosk to instantly post that on the chat. And everything will be triggered as text first. But this allows the user to just speak if the user prefers to speak. So, we are going to use Vosk. It's spelled as V-O-S-K-E, and it is a speech-to-text that will transcribe in real time. It will run on the main server for the fastest possible response in real time. On its Node.js NPM version that we will need to install. So, this allows the user to go in voice mode or text mode, and we will allow the user to type or choose simply speak.

# 🧠 Right Sidebar — Conversational AI System Specification

## Overview

The **Right Sidebar** is the intelligent assistant and conversational surface of the platform.  
It acts as a **cursor-like copilot**, blending chat, voice, and UI awareness to create a fast, human-feeling interaction layer.  

Its goal is to always keep the user *engaged, informed, and accompanied* — never waiting in silence, and always receiving immediate feedback even while larger computations run.

---

## 🗣️ Message Flow — Core Mechanics

Every user input (text or voice) triggers a **three-tiered AI message flow**:

1. **Hidden Message** — an immediate, context-aware “thinking” message.
2. **Pre-Response** — a short “aha moment” acknowledging the user’s request.
3. **Response** — the complete, thoughtful answer to the request.

---

### Step-by-Step Flow (Non-Voice Mode)

#### 1️⃣ User Sends Message
- The user submits text → message is added to the chat.
- Instantly, a **Hidden Message** is posted to the chat (pre-generated).

#### 2️⃣ Hidden Message
- Created *before* the user’s latest message was read.  
- Mentions elements of prior context but doesn’t reference the new input directly.  
- Purpose: keep engagement and show cognitive presence (“thinking,” “considering,” “analyzing…”).
- Length: short paragraph (~1–2 sentences).
- Example tone:
  > “Hmm… that’s interesting. Let me think this through with what we’ve discussed about your workflows…”

#### 3️⃣ Async Requests Begin
Two requests are fired **simultaneously**:
- Request A → **Pre-Response**
- Request B → **Response**

#### 4️⃣ Pre-Response
- Short, fast, context-aware paragraph (~2–4 sentences).
- Triggered as soon as the model reads the new user input.
- Acts as an **acknowledgment + outline**:
  > “Got it — you’re asking how to connect the schema update logic. Here’s how I’ll approach it…”

- Appears in chat first unless the Response beats it (in which case it’s skipped).

#### 5️⃣ Response
- Full message (~3 paragraphs) completing the user’s request.  
- Once received:
  1. Posted in chat immediately (with letter streaming effect).  
  2. Appended to conversation context.  
  3. **Next Hidden Message** is generated asynchronously for future readiness.

#### 6️⃣ Next Hidden Message Generation
- Triggered **as soon as the response text arrives**.
- Generates in background so it’s ready before the user sends their next input.
- Behavior is identical across voice and non-voice modes.

## 🔁 Voice Mode (Audio + Text)

When **voice mode** is active, the same flow applies — but each message has both **text** and **audio** components.

### Processing Details
- **Models Used:**  
  - Text → `GPT-5-Nano`  
  - Audio → `OpenAI Whisper` (TTS + transcription)
- **Prompt Versioning:** `LangSmith`
- **Context Management:** `LangChain` (conversation + activity logs)

---

### Voice Mode Flow

| Phase | Description | Audio Behavior |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Hidden Message** | Instantly displayed + plays corresponding audio. | Text appears letter-by-letter while audio begins immediately. |
| **Pre-Response** | Generated from new input; short acknowledgment. | Text + audio generated asynchronously and played as soon as available. |
| **Response** | Full result; streamed in text and voice simultaneously. | Audio begins as text streaming starts. |
| **Next Hidden Message** | Triggered as soon as response text starts streaming. | Hidden text generated first → then Whisper creates hidden audio. |

### Timing Rules
- Both pre-response and response trigger **text-then-audio** generation asynchronously.  
- Audio playback always starts **immediately when text streaming begins**.
- The **next hidden message** is prepared right after the **response text** arrives — **not** after audio finishes.

---

## ✨ Streaming Effect

The text display uses **character streaming** (token-by-token rendering) similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT UI.  
This creates perceived immediacy and lets users read while the model “thinks.”  
The correct technical name for this is **token streaming** (or **incremental streaming**).

---

## 🧩 Context & Memory

### Conversation Context
- Each request to GPT-5-Nano includes:
  - The **last N user-assistant messages**.
  - The **hidden message context** (previous thinking state).
  - The **activity log snippets**.

### Activity Logs
- Captured automatically as the user interacts with the SaaS platform.
- Stored in a contextual buffer.
- Appended to model input to improve relevance and personalization.

**Purpose:**  
The assistant references user activity naturally — “I noticed you edited the schema field earlier…” — to create a sense of intelligent awareness.

Logs may also appear in the sidebar as contextual tips or debugging insights.

**In Voice Mode:**
- Each message’s text triggers Whisper TTS to produce an accompanying audio clip.
- Text streaming and audio playback occur **synchronously**.
- Context updates only after response text finishes streaming.

---

## 💬 Message Types Summary

| Type | Trigger Timing | Content | Purpose | Length |
|------|----------------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Hidden Message** | Instant | Contextual "thinking" line | Keep user engaged while pre-response & response generate | ~1–2 sentences |
| **Pre-Response** | After user message | Short “aha” acknowledgment | Show understanding & bridge delay before full answer | ~3–4 sentences |
| **Response** | Full completion | Detailed reasoning or result | Deliver the final content to user | ~3 paragraphs |

---

## 🎧 Whisper Integration

- **Text → Audio Flow:**  
  After text generation (for pre-response or response), trigger a Whisper request to produce a natural voice version.

- **Playback:**  
  Audio starts immediately with text streaming to maintain continuity.

- **Format:**  
  `.mp3` or `.ogg` for web streaming.  
  Audio is cached and linked to message ID for replay.

## 🧱 UX Design Notes

- The sidebar should always **occupy a fixed position** on the right.
- Messages appear in a vertical stack (chat format).
- Hidden and pre-responses use **distinct visual cues** (e.g., animated “thinking dots” for hidden, lighter color for pre-response).
- Voice mode displays a **waveform animation** while audio plays.
- Streaming text shows **progressively appearing characters**, optionally with a blinking cursor effect.
- Contextual logs appear in small, collapsible blocks (optional reveal).
- Users can hover over messages to see timestamps and model types (hidden, pre, response).

---

## ✅ Behavioral Summary

1. Always respond instantly (hidden message ready at all times).
2. Maintain async pre-response and response orchestration.
3. Generate next hidden message when response text arrives.
4. Sync audio with text display (voice mode).
5. Append logs + message history to every request.
6. Use streaming for immediacy and engagement.
7. Keep UX consistent: text, audio, and contextual logs work harmoniously.

---

## 💡 Key Advantages

- **Zero perceived latency:** The user always sees something happening.
- **Natural conversational pacing:** Mimics human delay patterns.
- **Multimodal continuity:** Text and voice synchronized seamlessly.
- **Contextual intelligence:** References real actions on the platform.
- **Efficient token usage:** GPT-5-Nano for text + Whisper for voice = low latency, low cost.

# 🧩 Sidebar Logic Addendum — Input Complexity & Error Handling

## 🧠 Input Complexity Check (Hidden Message Skipping Logic)

### Purpose
To avoid awkward or unnecessary "thinking" moments when the user input is short or purely command-like.

### Behavior

1. **Character Count Evaluation**
   - When the user sends a message, the system immediately measures its character length.
   - Define a configurable threshold, e.g.:

     ```js
     const MIN_HIDDEN_MESSAGE_THRESHOLD = 60; // can be tuned
     ```

2. **Decision Flow**
   ```text
   IF user_input.length < MIN_HIDDEN_MESSAGE_THRESHOLD
       → Skip hidden message
       → Proceed directly with async pre-response + response generation
   ELSE
       → Display hidden message instantly (as usual)
       → Launch pre-response + response concurrently
   END IF


# 🎙️ Voice Input Integration — Vosk STT (Speech-to-Text) Specification

## Overview

The platform supports **two input modes**:

1. **Text Mode** — user types directly in the chat input.  
2. **Voice Mode** — user speaks, and their speech is instantly transcribed into text using **Vosk**.

This allows users to interact freely using either typing or speaking, without losing any chat context or system behavior consistency.

---

## 🧩 Core Components

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Vosk (STT)** | Real-time speech-to-text transcription |
| **Whisper (TTS)** | Converts model responses back into natural voice |
| **GPT-5-Nano** | Text generation engine (hidden, pre-response, response) |
| **Node.js Server** | Hosts Vosk for fastest possible inference |
| **Frontend Client** | Captures microphone input and streams audio to the server |

---

## ⚙️ Server Setup

### Library
Use the **Node.js NPM version of Vosk** (spelled `vosk` — not `voske`).

```bash
npm install vosk


The STT server listens for WebSocket audio streams.

As the user speaks, the audio stream is transcribed in real time.

Partial transcripts (partial results) are sent continuously for live typing effects.

Once the user stops speaking, the final text is sent to the main app.

💬 Client-Side Flow
Input Mode Toggle

Users can choose between:

Typing: Standard text input.

Speaking: Click the microphone icon to activate speech input.

Voice Capture

Start microphone capture via the Web Audio API.

Stream PCM or 16kHz audio chunks to the server WebSocket.

Receive incremental transcription results from the Vosk server.

Display partial text in the chat input field live (as the user speaks).

When transcription is finalized, treat it exactly like a typed message.

## 🎙️ Integration with Chat Flow

1. **User presses Mic button → activates voice mode.**  
2. **Speech → Vosk → real-time text transcript in chat.**  
3. **Once transcription completes:**
   - The final text is posted to chat *as if typed*.  
   - Triggers the same async chain:
     - Hidden Message *(if applicable)*
     - Pre-Response  
     - Response  
     - Next Hidden Message generation  
4. **If voice mode is also active for playback**, Whisper generates corresponding audio for responses.

---

## ⚡ Performance Notes

- Running **Vosk on the main server** ensures minimal latency (no round-trip to third-party APIs).  
- The NPM Vosk implementation supports **multi-threading and GPU acceleration** if compiled with Kaldi libraries.  
- Use **short audio chunking (~0.2 s)** for smooth, low-latency streaming.  
- The **final transcript event** triggers once silence > 0.8 s is detected.


## 🎨 UX Enhancements

- Microphone button with **pulsing animation** while recording.  
- Partial transcription appears with a **typing animation** (greyed-out text).  
- Final transcription animates into a confirmed message.  
- If microphone permission is denied, gracefully **revert to text mode**.  
- Visual cues such as **“Listening…”**, **“Processing…”**, and **“Done.”** appear contextually.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Vosk (STT)** runs on the **main server** for real-time, low-latency speech transcription.  
- **Whisper (TTS)** handles response playback when in voice mode.  
- Users can **seamlessly switch** between typing and speaking.  
- Speech input is treated as **normal text**, ensuring compatibility with all async logic (hidden, pre-response, response).  
- The end result: a **fully multimodal conversational system** — fast, natural, and immersive.


- **WebSocket Isolation:**  
  Each voice stream uses a **dedicated WebSocket channel** tagged by `session_id + stream_id`.  
  Streams are never shared or reused between users or messages.

- **Thread Safety:**  
  Use **mutexes or task queues per `session_id`** to prevent overlap.  
  All async tasks are awaited or batched via **`Promise.allSettled`** to ensure no race conditions.

- **Memory Safety:**  
  Each chain disposes of temporary state after completion.  
  No global state mutation occurs outside its session scope.

---

## ✅ Guarantee

- ✅ No concurrency collisions  
- ✅ No message or audio “spillover” between sessions  
- ✅ Perfect sync between text, voice, and WebSocket events  
- ✅ Fully sandboxed, deterministic, and visually seamless user experience
