# 🎙️ Voice Mode Implementation — Complete

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented  
**Estimated Implementation Time:** ~4.5 hours

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **1. TTS API Route** (`/api/ai-sidebar/tts`)
- ✅ OpenAI Whisper TTS integration
- ✅ Fast model (`tts-1`) for low latency
- ✅ Returns audio/mpeg directly
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ 1-year cache headers

**File:** `src/app/api/ai-sidebar/tts/route.ts`

---

### **2. Audio Utilities** (`src/lib/ai-sidebar/audio-utils.ts`)
- ✅ `textToSpeech(text)` - Generates audio buffer from text
- ✅ `playAudio(buffer)` - Plays audio, waits for previous to finish
- ✅ `stopAudio()` - Stops currently playing audio
- ✅ Web Audio API integration
- ✅ Automatic queue management (sequential playback)

**Features:**
- Global AudioContext reused across calls
- Sequential playback (no overlap)
- Proper cleanup on stop
- Error handling throughout

---

### **3. Voice Mode Toggle** (AISidebar Header)
- ✅ Button in header next to close button
- ✅ Volume2 icon when enabled (cyan glow)
- ✅ VolumeX icon when disabled (grey)
- ✅ Hover states and smooth transitions
- ✅ Tooltip on hover

**Visual Cues:**
- Enabled: Cyan icon with cyan background glow
- Disabled: Grey icon, no background
- Position: Top right header, before close button

---

### **4. Pool Message Skipping in Voice Mode**
- ✅ Voice mode skips pool messages (waits for pre-response)
- ✅ Only uses saved hidden messages with audio
- ✅ Console logs for debugging which source is used
- ✅ Text mode still uses pool as fallback

**Logic:**
```typescript
if (voiceMode) {
  if (!nextHiddenMessage) {
    console.log('Voice mode: No saved hidden message, skipping to pre-response')
    // Skip hidden entirely
  } else {
    console.log('Voice mode: Using saved hidden message with audio')
    // Stream hidden + play audio
  }
} else {
  // Text mode: use pool or saved
}
```

---

### **5. Audio Generation & Streaming Integration**
- ✅ Audio generated in `streamMessage` when `data.done` arrives
- ✅ Audio generation happens in parallel with text completion
- ✅ Audio starts playing immediately after generation
- ✅ Sequential playback (waits for previous audio to finish)

**Flow:**
1. Text starts streaming (10ms per char)
2. When streaming completes (`data.done`)
3. Generate audio for complete text
4. Play audio immediately (queued if previous playing)

---

### **6. Audio Starts When First Character Streams**
- ✅ Hidden messages with saved audio play when first character streams
- ✅ LangSmith messages generate audio after text completes, then play
- ✅ No delays - audio starts as soon as available

**Implementation:**
- Saved hidden: Audio generated beforehand, plays at first char
- Pre-response/Response: Audio generated after text done, plays immediately

---

### **7. Next Hidden Audio Generation & Storage**
- ✅ `generateAndSaveNextHidden` now generates both text and audio
- ✅ Audio stored in `nextHiddenAudio` state
- ✅ Both ready for next message
- ✅ Audio only generated if voice mode is enabled

**Behavior:**
```typescript
// After response completes:
1. Generate next hidden text
2. If voice mode: Also generate audio
3. Store both for next user message
4. When user sends message: Play audio with first char
```

---

### **8. UI Enhancements**
- ✅ Solid black background for messages area (`bg-black/95`)
- ✅ Glassmorphism for header and footer (`bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-xl`)
- ✅ Voice mode button with proper styling
- ✅ Audio cleanup on component unmount

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Text Mode (Voice Mode OFF):**
```
User sends message
  ↓
[Hidden: Pool or saved] (text streams 10ms/char)
  ↓
[Pre-Response: LangSmith] (text streams 10ms/char)
  ↓
[Response: LangSmith] (text streams 10ms/char)
  ↓
Generate next hidden (text only) → Save for next time
```

### **Voice Mode (Voice Mode ON):**
```
User sends message
  ↓
[Hidden: Saved only] (text streams 10ms/char + audio plays from start)
  ↓
[Pre-Response: LangSmith] (text streams → audio generated → audio plays)
  ↓
[Response: LangSmith] (text streams → audio generated → audio plays)
  ↓
Generate next hidden (text + audio) → Save both for next time
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### **1. Sequential Audio Playback**
- Audio never overlaps
- Each audio waits for previous to finish
- Implemented in `playAudio()` using promises

### **2. Zero Delays Between Messages**
- Text streaming unchanged (10ms per char)
- 100ms pause between message types (same as before)
- Audio generation happens in background
- Audio plays as soon as ready

### **3. Smart Pool Skipping**
- Voice mode: Skip pool, only use saved hidden
- Reason: Pool has no audio, takes same time as pre-response
- Falls through to pre-response if no saved hidden

### **4. Proper State Management**
- `voiceMode` - boolean flag
- `nextHiddenAudio` - AudioBuffer for next message
- `audioQueueRef` - Reference for cleanup
- `isPlayingRef` - Track playback state

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Text Mode (Voice Mode OFF):**
- [ ] Short message (<60 chars) - no hidden, just pre + response
- [ ] Long message (≥60 chars) - hidden + pre + response
- [ ] Hidden message uses pool if no saved
- [ ] Hidden message uses saved if available
- [ ] Token streaming speed unchanged (10ms)
- [ ] No audio plays

### **Voice Mode (Voice Mode ON):**
- [ ] Toggle button changes icon (Volume2/VolumeX)
- [ ] Toggle button shows cyan glow when enabled
- [ ] Short message - no hidden, just pre + response (with audio)
- [ ] Long message with saved hidden - hidden + pre + response (all with audio)
- [ ] Long message without saved hidden - skip to pre + response (with audio)
- [ ] Audio plays sequentially (no overlap)
- [ ] Audio starts as text streams
- [ ] Next hidden audio generated and saved
- [ ] Token streaming speed unchanged (10ms)

### **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Switching voice mode mid-conversation
- [ ] Audio errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Component unmount stops audio
- [ ] Multiple rapid messages queued properly
- [ ] No audio lag or glitches

2. Voice selection (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
3. Playback speed control (0.5x - 2x)
4. Pause/resume audio controls
5. Audio waveform visualization
6. Audio caching (reduce TTS API calls)

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### **1. Skip Pool in Voice Mode**
**Decision:** Skip pool messages in voice mode  
**Reason:** Pool has no audio, takes time to generate audio = same delay as pre-response  
**Benefit:** Cleaner UX, faster engagement, only contextual messages have voice

### **2. Audio Generation Timing**
**Decision:** Generate audio after text completes  
**Reason:** Need full text for quality TTS, streaming partial audio is complex  
**Benefit:** Simple implementation, good quality audio

### **3. Sequential Audio Playback**
**Decision:** Wait for previous audio before playing next  
**Reason:** Multiple overlapping voices are confusing  
**Benefit:** Clear, professional voice experience

### **4. Solid Black Messages Background**
**Decision:** Use `bg-black/95` for messages area  
**Reason:** User wanted solid black for readability, glassmorphism for header/footer  
**Benefit:** Clear text, distinct visual sections
