## üí∞ FREE TIER NOTES

### **What to Expect:**

**Cold Starts:**
- Service spins down after 15 min inactivity
- First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Subsequent requests are instant

**When It Happens:**
- First user of the day
- After 15 min of no one using Draw.io
- Not during active editing session

**What Counts as "Use":**
- Opening the Draw.io modal (HTTP request)
- **NOT:** Drawing, dragging, typing (all client-side)

**User Experience:**
```
User 1 (9:00 AM):  Opens Draw.io ‚Üí Waits 30s ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
User 1 (9:05 AM):  Opens again ‚Üí Instant ‚úÖ
User 2 (9:10 AM):  Opens Draw.io ‚Üí Instant ‚úÖ
[15 min pass, no one using]
User 3 (9:30 AM):  Opens Draw.io ‚Üí Waits 30s ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
```

### **Avoiding Cold Starts (Optional):**

**Option A: Upgrade to Starter**
- Cost: $7/month
- Benefit: Always on, no cold starts
- Recommended for: Production apps

**Option B: Keep-Alive Ping**
- Use UptimeRobot (free): https://uptimerobot.com
- Ping every 10 minutes: `https://nexa-drawio.onrender.com`
- Keeps service warm
- Recommended for: Development if you hate waiting

**Option C: Accept It**
- 30s wait is acceptable for most users
- Only happens occasionally
- Saves $7/month
- Recommended for: Low-traffic, budget-conscious projects

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES

### **Issue: "Root Directory not found"**
**Fix:** Make sure `docker-root` exists in your repo root
```bash
# Check:
ls -la docker-root/
# Should show: Dockerfile, README.md, etc.
```

### **Issue: "Dockerfile not found"**
**Fix:** 
- Check Dockerfile Path is `./Dockerfile` (relative to root directory)
- Check Root Directory is `docker-root`
- NOT: `docker-root/Dockerfile` (that's wrong)

### **Issue: Build takes forever**
**Normal:** First build takes 5-10 minutes (downloading base image)
**Future builds:** 2-3 minutes (cached)

### **Issue: Service keeps restarting**
**Check logs for:**
- OutOfMemory errors ‚Üí Upgrade instance
- Port binding errors ‚Üí Check Dockerfile exposes 8080
- Health check fails ‚Üí Wait longer, check endpoint

### **Issue: CSP errors still appear**
**Verify:**
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRAWIO_URL` is correct
2. NEXA service redeployed after env var change
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Try incognito mode

### **Issue: 502 Bad Gateway**
**Means:** Service is starting but not ready
**Fix:** Wait 30-60 seconds, refresh

### **Issue: Draw.io loads but can't save**
**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- DrawioEditor.tsx origin validation
