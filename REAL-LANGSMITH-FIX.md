# 🚨 **REAL LANGSMITH FIX - INPUT VARIABLES MISSING!**

## **🎯 THE ACTUAL PROBLEM:**

Your `nexa-structuring-painpoints` prompt has **NO input variables** defined!

```json
"input_variables": []  // ← THIS IS WHY IT IGNORES USER INPUT!
```

## **🔍 COMPARISON:**

### **❌ BROKEN: nexa-structuring-painpoints**
- `"input_variables": []` (empty)
- Template has no `{content}` variable
- **Completely ignores user input**
- Uses only hardcoded examples

### **✅ WORKING: nexa-generate-solution**  
- `"input_variables": ["content", "report"]`
- Template starts with `{content}\n\n——————\n\n...`
- **Actually uses user input**
- Works perfectly

## **🛠️ LANGSMITH FIX REQUIRED:**

### **Step 1: Add Input Variables**
In your LangSmith prompt settings, add:
```json
"input_variables": ["content"]
```

### **Step 2: Modify Template**
Your template should reference the user input. Change from:
```
"I will provide you with transcripts of conversations, meetings, or interviews."
```

To:
```
"Analyze the following content:

{content}

Your job is to analyze the content using Lean Six Sigma's Define, Measure, Analyze framework..."
```

## **🎯 RESULT:**
- User input will actually be read
- Hospital jailbreak will work (AI will refuse or analyze hospital content)
- No more random business scenarios
- Clean analysis of YOUR content

**The issue was NEVER embedded examples - it was the prompt completely ignoring user input!**
