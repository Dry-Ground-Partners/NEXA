# This file represents the NEXA logo without name
# In a real implementation, this would be the actual PNG file
# For now, we'll update the code to use text-based logos
# 
# The actual NEXA logo should be:
# - Transparent PNG
# - 40px height for header
# - Professional appearance
# - White/light colored for dark theme
